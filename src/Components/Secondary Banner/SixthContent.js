          Many venture studios and VCs are stuck in spreadsheets<br />
          and outdated models. Aifer has been engineered to build<br />
          modern business by harnessing new technologies and AI<br />
          in everything we build.

          We set a limit of working on 3 pre-seed ventures at any <br />
          one time. We choose our ventures meticulously based on <br />
          where we see the most opportunity and where we feel we <br />
          can add the most value.

          We invest in people and ideas we believe in, even <br />
          without initial funding. Unlike other studios and funds <br />
          who will require you to have come to the table investors <br />
          ready to go and a working MVP.

        <p className="paraTen">
          Too many modern ventures don't have a clear strategy <br />
          to get to revenue quickly. This won't fly with the <br />
          radically changing investment landscape. That's why all <br />
          of our ventures have a clear route to revenue from the outset.
